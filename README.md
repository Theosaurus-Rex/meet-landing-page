## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that using `background-gradient` in CSS is a nifty way of adding an image with a coloured overlay, without having to add in an additonal div for the overlay and mess with positioning.
